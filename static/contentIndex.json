Communication (Weeks 5-8)\nAdd personality-driven agents with specialized expertise:\n\nVendor Relationship Manager - Negotiation protocols, supplier communication\nSales Support Specialist - Lead qualification, proposal generation\nQuality Assurance Overseer - Compliance monitoring, testing protocols\n\nPhase 3: Strategic &amp; Creative (Weeks 9-12)\nDeploy high-level decision-making agents:\n\nBusiness Intelligence Analyst - Market trends, competitive analysis\nProduct Development Coordinator - Innovation pipeline management\nStrategic Planning Assistant - Growth planning, resource allocation\n\nThe Personality &amp; Expertise Matrix\nWhy AI Agent Personalities Matter:\n\nDialectic Growth - Different perspectives drive better solutions\nSpecialized Expertise - Domain-focused knowledge and decision-making\nConsistent Performance - No mood swings, always professional\nScalable Training - One training session, infinite deployment\n\nAgent Personality Archetypes:\n\nThe Analyst - Data-driven, methodical, risk-averse (Finance, Compliance)\nThe Relationship Builder - Communication-focused, empathetic (Sales, Vendor Relations)\nThe Problem Solver - Creative, adaptive, solution-oriented (R&amp;D, Operations)\nThe Guardian - Detail-oriented, quality-focused (QA, Production)\nThe Strategist - Big-picture thinking, planning-oriented (Management, Growth)\n\nThe Mathematics of AI Efficiency\nConservative Estimates:\n\nAverage knowledge worker: 60-80% time on automatable tasks\n20-person company: 960-1280 hours/week of automatable work\nAI agent capacity: 24/7 operation = 168 hours/week per agent\nROI Calculation: 6-8 AI agents = 20+ human equivalent capacity\n\nThe Compound Effect:\ngraph LR\n    A[Manual Processes] --&gt;
