# Obsidian to Quartz Publishing Workflow

## The Knowledge Management Challenge

Organizations and individuals often maintain extensive private knowledge bases in tools like Obsidian, but struggle to selectively publish valuable insights to public platforms. This workflow bridges that gap, enabling seamless content curation from private notes to professional portfolio sites.

## Current Obsidian Structure Analysis

Based on your current repository structure:

```
private/
├── daily-notes/          # Personal reflection and planning
├── meetings/            # Leadership and project meetings
├── projects/            # Active project documentation
└── todos/              # Task management and parking lot items
```

### Content Classification Framework

```mermaid

    A[Obsidian Private Notes] --> B{Content Classification}
    
    B -->|Personal| C[Daily Notes<br/>Private Thoughts<br/>Personal TODOs]
    B -->|Confidential| D[Company Names<br/>Client Details<br/>Internal Processes]
    B -->|Publishable| E[Methodologies<br/>Frameworks<br/>Technical Insights]
    B -->|Case Studies| F[Anonymized Examples<br/>Lessons Learned<br/>Best Practices]
    
    C --> G[Keep Private]
    D --> H[Sanitize & Anonymize]
    E --> I[Direct Publication]
    F --> J[Curated Publication]
    
    H --> K[Review & Approve]

    style L fill:#284b63,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
```

## Automated Publishing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Content Extraction and Sanitization

```mermaid

    A[Obsidian Vault] --> B[Content Scanner]
    B --> C[Classification Engine]
    C --> D[Sanitization Process]
    D --> E[Review Queue]
    E --> F[Approved Content]
    F --> G[Quartz Repository]
    
    H[AI Agent] -.-> B
    H -.-> C
    H -.-> D
    
    I[Human Review] -.-> E
    
    style H fill:#84a59d,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
    style I fill:#284b63,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
```

### Sanitization Rules Engine

**Automatic Removals:**
- Personal names (replace with roles: "CEO", "Tech Lead", "QA Engineer")
- Company names (replace with industry descriptors: "Manufacturing Client", "SaaS Startup")
- Specific dollar amounts (replace with ranges: "$X-Y range")
- Internal system names (replace with generic terms: "CRM System", "Inventory Platform")

**Content Enhancement:**
- Add context for public audience
- Include relevant diagrams and visualizations
- Cross-reference related public content
- Add appropriate tags and metadata

## Content Transformation Examples

### From Private Meeting Notes to Public Insights

**Private Note (meetings/KPI Themes.md):**
```markdown
# Weekly Leadership Meeting Prep

1. Development work - keeping up
   - Mari needs more support with documentation
   - Bulk and QA always have needed documentation
2. Shopify catalog and expansion
   - Work with Amber on updates
   - Samples getting onto Shopify
```

**Published Insight (insights/Manufacturing Team Coordination.md):**
```markdown
# Manufacturing Team Coordination Patterns

## Development Team Support Structure
- Technical documentation requires dedicated resources
- Quality assurance processes need continuous documentation updates
- Cross-functional collaboration essential for catalog management

## E-commerce Integration Challenges
- Product catalog synchronization between systems
- Sample management and customer-facing platforms
- Marketing and sales alignment on product updates
```

### From Daily Notes to Methodology Documentation

**Private Note (daily-notes/2025-08-06.md):**
```markdown
│ the next thing to do here is get the dev-agent a branch for this repo, 
│ then start it up on an endpoint. do the same for the pm-agent repo. 
│ then, have the pm agent look over this project and ensure it approves 
│ scope and tickets, and that work is ready for the dev agent.
```

**Published Framework (documentation/AI Agent Workflow.md):**
```markdown
## Multi-Agent Development Workflow

### Agent Coordination Pattern
1. **Project Manager Agent** reviews scope and tickets
2. **Development Agent** receives approved work items
3. **Quality Assurance Agent** validates implementation
4. **Integration Agent** manages deployment pipeline

This pattern reduces cognitive overhead through effective 
AI-agent data management and work tracking systems.
```

## Technical Implementation

### Content Scanner Configuration

```python
# content-scanner.py
class ObsidianContentScanner:
    def __init__(self, vault_path, output_path):
        self.vault_path = vault_path
        self.output_path = output_path
        self.publishable_patterns = [
            'methodology',
            'framework',
            'best practice',
            'lesson learned',
            'insight'
        ]
    
    def scan_daily_notes(self):
        # Extract insights from daily notes
        # Apply sanitization rules
        # Generate publishable content
        pass
    
    def scan_meeting_notes(self):
        # Extract methodologies and frameworks
        # Remove confidential information
        # Create anonymized case studies
        pass
```

    H -.-> G
    
    style H fill:#84a59d,stroke:#fff,color:#fff
```
